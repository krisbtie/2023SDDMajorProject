        <p class="card-text">According to the 2021 Australian Census, 5.8% of the population reported needing assistance with core activities, such as self-care, communication, and mobility. This suggests that there is a significant need for support for people with core activity needs in Australia. This support can come from a variety of sources, including family, friends, government services, and non-government organisations. It is important to ensure that people with core activity needs have access to the support they need to live independently and participate fully in society.

          <h5>Core Activity Need for Assistance by Age Group as at 2021 Census</h5>
          <p>As per the 2021 Australian Census, need for assistance with core activities increases with age (with some outliers), with the highest percentage of people reporting needing assistance in the 85 years and over age group. This is likely due to a number of factors, including the natural decline in physical and cognitive function that occurs with age, as well as the increased likelihood of chronic health conditions.</p>
